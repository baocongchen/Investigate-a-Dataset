# Investigate-a-Dataset
## Udacity Data Analysis Project 2

## Introduction
For this project, we will conduct data analysis and create a file to share that documents our findings. We start by taking a look at the dataset and brainstorming what questions we could answer using it. Then we use Pandas and NumPy to answer the questions we are most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers.
